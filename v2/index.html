					<div>
						My work seeks the convergence of technology and creativity. During my PhD at HKUST, I design efficient and accessible systems for machine learning, with publications in top conferences.
						Earlier, as COO at Vincross Robotics (2016-2020), I led a global team to make HEXA a world-recognized robot, and was interviewed by WSJ and IEEE.

						Outside of work, I enjoy art and music whenever I can. I dance Argentine Tango and have a love for Golden Age Tango Music. My favorite artist is Edward Hopper for his Nightawks (1942) and more. I recommend the timeless musical Les Misérables to everyone. Besides my hometown Jinan, I called Ann Arbor, Beijing, Berkeley and Hong Kong home.

				<h2>Academic Research</h2>
				<p>I design and build systems for machine learning (ML) that aims to significantly improve the efficiency and accessibility of large-scale ML. My work optimizes parallelization, pipelining, and resource scheduling of ML workloads by leveraging their inherent patterns and characteristics.
